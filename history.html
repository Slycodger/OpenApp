    <li>After a while I am back</li>

    <li>Image loading is done and I changed most things to use static functions</li>
    <li>Except for images which needed 'special' treatment</li>
    <li>Textures can be created from images</li>
    <li>Might get some model loading stuff done today</li>
    <br />
